# RockPaperScissors
A small rock paper scissor game that I have made due to boredom. 

## The game has two difficulties: normal and impossible.


## Buiding the game
### With ncurses
cd RockPaperScissors
cmake .

### With standard C++
Delete the em{-DNCURSES} flag from  CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS  then run 
cmake .

#### The project depends on the ncurses library (but can be built without it).
